However, randomized controlled data are lacking and given the variable natural history of desmoids, it is difficult to establish and qualify the benefit of this treatment regimen.",

The cumulative risk of rectal cancer varies from 2-24%, while the cumulative risk of dying from rectal cancer is between 9-12.5% following rectal-sparing procedures.",

Odds ratios for CRC-related mortality range from 0.11-0.22, all significant.",

For most patients, the choice of surgery will be between total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) and proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). Decisions regarding the timing and type of operation should be discussed at a specialist center in a multidisciplinary setting and take into account disease phenotype (colon and rectal polyp burden, extensiveness of rectal involvement, presence and size of high-grade dysplasia, increase in polyp burden between screenings, severity of symptoms); genotype; family planning; personal and family history of desmoid disease; social, personal, and educational factors; likelihood of compliance with follow-up; and the pros and cons of the surgical options. The age of prophylactic colectomy is not fixed and is a topic that should be discussed in adolescence.",

Patients should be followed in dedicated units (national registries, genetic counseling centers, or high-risk cancer centers) where surveillance recommendations are monitored and audited, in order to improve adherence and provide the highest quality of care. Patients should also have access to a full range of management options that minimize the risk of morbidity and mortality.",

There is some evidence that screen-detection of duodenal cancer may improve survival; FAP patients have been shown to have a median survival after a screen-detected cancer of 8 years (95% CI, 5.9 – upper end not estimated), versus 0.8 years (95% CI, 0.03-1.7) after symptomatic cancer (p < 0.0001)."
